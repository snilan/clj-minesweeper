About:
   This is my attempt at writing a functional(ish) minesweeper in Clojure.
   Since Clojure targets three different environments (JVM, CLR, and JavaScript),
   I'm trying to write the actual logic in a platform-agnostic manner.
   
   This is still very much a work in progress.

Usage:
   (none yet)
